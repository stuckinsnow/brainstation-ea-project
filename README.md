# Prize Winning Hackathon Group Project for EA Sports - 1st Place!
## ðŸ¦¾ Apex Legends Digital Twin ðŸŽ®

<p>
  EA Sports posed the question: "how can we enhance interaction between gamers?"
</p>

<p>Our solution revolved around the idea of a theoretical bot which would learn from both a mechanical standpoint but also from human behaviour, consequently it would interact with other gamers in a way that would be the ideal role model. With our website, you can play videos and thumbs up or thumbs down a video. This is to demonstrate that you'd be able to train the digital twin by giving a "thumbs up" to behaviour that's seen as moral, and a "thumbs down" for immoral behaviour.</p>
